Welcome to the KodeKloud CKAD Lightning Lab - Part 2!
NOTE: You can toggle between the questions but make sure that that you click on END EXAM before the the timer runs out.
While this test environment is valid for 60 minutes, challenge yourself and try to complete all 5 questions within 30 minutes! To pass, correctly complete at least 4 out of 5 questions. Good Luck!!!

We have deployed a few pods in this cluster in various namespaces. Inspect them and identify the pod which is not in a Ready state. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

Next, add a check to restart the container on the same pod if the command ls /var/www/html/file_check fails. This check should start after a delay of 10 seconds and run every 60 seconds.
